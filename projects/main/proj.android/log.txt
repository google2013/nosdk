       [dx] warning: Ignoring InnerClasses attribute for an anonymous inner class
       [dx] (b.d) that doesn't come with an
       [dx] associated EnclosingMethod attribute. This class was probably produced by a
       [dx] compiler that did not target the modern .class file format. The recommended
       [dx] solution is to recompile the class from source, using an up-to-date compiler
       [dx] and without specifying any "-target" type options. The consequence of ignoring
       [dx] this warning is that reflective operations on this class will incorrectly
       [dx] indicate that it is *not* an inner class.

       [dx] associated EnclosingMethod attribute. This class was probably produced by a

       [dx] this warning is that reflective operations on this class will incorrectly
       [dx] indicate that it is *not* an inner class.

       [dx] (com.alipay.sdk.app.H5PayActivity$1) that doesn't come with an
       [dx] associated EnclosingMethod attribute. This class was probably produced by a
       [dx] compiler that did not target the modern .class file format. The recommended
       [dx] solution is to recompile the class from source, using an up-to-date compiler
       [dx] and without specifying any "-target" type options. The consequence of ignoring
       [dx] this warning is that reflective operations on this class will incorrectly
       [dx] indicate that it is *not* an inner class.
